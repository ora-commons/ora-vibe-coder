"""The six target CLIs Agent Bridge can call, and how one call is described.

Agent Bridge knows exactly six target CLIs, named once here and never
discovered at runtime. Looking one up is a literal six-way switch: there is no
registry, plugin search, name-derived import, or connector base class. Adding a
target means editing this file, which is the point - the set of programs the
bridge will start is visible in source.

Each target has one hand-written module offering exactly two operations:
answer whether the target could be used right now, and compose the one fixed
argument vector a turn runs. ZCode and Hermes have no dependable standard-input
prompt path, so the body reaches them as one bound command-line option. Hermes,
MiniMax, and Qwen are courier-only and receive no project. Qwen alone has a
documented target-side preprocessing exception; Bridge still records and hands
over its original body unchanged.

This module also holds what the connectors share, and the sharing is
deliberately shallow: a handful of plain functions, called by each, and no
inheritance. Finding the program, reading its version, describing this
computer, running one of a harness's own cheap questions inside the turn's
deadline, and proving that a restriction switch really exists on the installed
version are the same work whichever harness is being asked, so they are written
once. Everything that differs between two harnesses - which switches, which
questions, what the answers mean - stays in that harness's own module, where a
reader can see the whole of it in one place.

Finally it holds the two small fixed shapes the rest of the code passes around:
what a connector claims to have been tested against, and what one bounded call
to a peer program consists of, beside the attributed final text a parser of a
structured output format may return.

    Each attribute is the exact single-line string the tool's own output

    ordered name/value pairs, so the whole value stays immutable; the caller
    turns it into a mapping at the moment it starts the process.

    There is deliberately no prompt field and no command string: the body is
    the runner's to hand over, and a connector only says how. `body_argument`
    is `None` for every harness whose program reads standard input, which is
    the required transport wherever one exists, and the runner then writes the
    body there. A connector may set it only for a program that has demonstrably
    no standard-input path for a one-shot prompt, established by probe. The
    runner then appends the body to `argv` as exactly one final argument, with
    this string in front of it, and writes nothing to standard input. The
    string is empty when the vector already ends in a bare `--` and the body
    follows it whole, and it is the option's own attached prefix - `--oneshot=`
    - when the program's parser will not let a bare `--` stand before a single
    option value. Either way nothing in the body can be read as an option. A
    body that would push the process-creation payload - the vector, the
    environment and their overhead together - past what this computer
    supports, less explicit headroom, is refused before any request is
    published, and is never truncated, split or spilled to a file; so is a
    body holding a NUL byte, which no argument can carry. Under either
    transport prompt text never passes through a shell. `warnings` are the
    concrete limits a successful check and run must surface. `response_parser`
    extracts final text when the fixed output is structured; when that same
    output reports which provider and model answered, the parser returns the
    text as `AttributedText` - the final text unchanged with the reported
    identity attached - and the runner carries that identity to the extended
