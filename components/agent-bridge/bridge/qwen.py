"""The hand-written Qwen Code courier connector.

Qwen Code 0.23.0 supplies a safe mode, explicit plan posture, run budgets,
zero-model-tool-call guard, and stream-JSON standard input and output.
The connector keeps the user's normal QWEN_HOME so authentication is not
hidden, while putting transient output inside the task-owned neutral directory
and disabling compatible usage statistics and telemetry for this child. Qwen
alone may preprocess the unchanged body before the model; that exception is
reported explicitly rather than hidden behind the later zero-tool-call budget.
There is deliberately no work builder and no image route: `CAPABILITIES`
records the source-read reasons (approval modes that either cannot ask
headlessly or auto-approve, and a stream-json reader that stringifies
non-text content), so work mode is refused with that finding instead of built.

#: What this connector offers beyond its restricted review call: nothing, and
#: for stated reasons read out of the installed program. Qwen Code 0.23.0's
#: ordinary approval mode (`--approval-mode default`) requires manual approval
#: for file edits and shell commands, and a headless run cannot ask: in text
#: mode the call is cancelled with "the host could not present the required
#: approval", and in stream-json mode the program asks the calling host to
#: approve, which would make Bridge the permission authority. The modes that
#: proceed unattended (`auto-edit`, `auto`, `yolo`) are automatic approval
#: modes, which Bridge must not enable to make headless work succeed. For
#: images, the stream-json reader turns every non-text content block into
#: JSON text rather than pixels, and there is no attachment switch.
