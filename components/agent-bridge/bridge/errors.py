"""The one internal list of ways an Agent Bridge turn can fail.

This enumeration is implementation-internal. It is not a public protocol, not a
wire format, and not a third-party compatibility surface: nothing outside this
repository should depend on the member names or on their spelling, and they may
be renamed whenever the code needs it.

Its purpose is narrow. Connectors translate whatever a vendor's command-line
program did into exactly one of these members and may not invent private codes
of their own. Only the runner turns a member into words, using `render()` below,
so every failure reaches a person the same way: what happened, and the one thing
to do next.
