"""Starting one program, waiting for one answer, and leaving nothing behind.

Everything Agent Bridge starts is started here, the same way, under the same
deadline, and cleaned up the same way. There is one function worth
understanding, `run_bounded`, and the care in it is all about two questions:
what may be started, and what must be gone afterwards.

**What may be started.** A fixed list of arguments, with no shell anywhere. The
outgoing Markdown goes down the program's standard input, or, for the one kind
of connector that has proved its harness has no standard-input path, arrives
bound to an option as a single final argument that the runner composed; either
way no shell ever sees it, so text a peer or a plan may have influenced never
becomes part of a command.

**What must be gone afterwards.** The child is started as its own session
leader, which makes it the leader of a brand new process group containing it and
anything it starts. That group is the exact set of processes this turn owns.
Cleanup signals that group and nothing else - never a name, never a scan of
unrelated processes, never a guess. Before signalling anything, the code
confirms that the group's number really is the child's own process id, which is
the check that makes it impossible to signal the group Agent Bridge itself is
running in.

On Windows the same ownership is built with that platform's own primitives,
because the Unix ones do not exist there. The child is created with
`CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` and `CREATE_SUSPENDED`: the first makes it the
leader of a brand new group numbered by its own process id - the direct twin
of the new session, and the fact the ownership check relies on rather than
reads back - and the second leaves its primary thread unstarted, so that not
one instruction of the child's own has run. The polite signal is the console
break event that group exists to receive, a courtesy a child may ignore and a
console-less caller cannot even send. The guarantee lives elsewhere, in
ownership that does not need the root alive to be exercised and that now
precedes execution outright: while the child is still suspended it is placed
in a Windows job object configured to kill on close, and only then is the
primary thread resumed, so everything the child ever starts - including
whatever it starts with its first instruction - is a member of that job with
no breakaway allowed, and the tree stays owned whichever of its processes
dies first. Closing this code's handle to the job is the forced phase - the
kernel terminates every member, root or descendant - and the same close is
what happens if Agent Bridge itself is killed, because the operating system
closes a process's handles when it ends. The operating system's own
`taskkill /T /F` on the root pid remains as a belt-and-braces force and as
the confirmation, with one limit: its tree walk starts at the root, so once
the root has exited, not-found says nothing about the descendants it would
have named. Not-found is therefore read as emptiness only after the job has
been closed, and a platform that refuses the job or the resume refuses the
turn - what was just started has never run, so it is terminated outright
with nothing yet beside it, and the refusal is the answer rather than a tree
nobody owns. The Unix branches below are untouched by all of this, and no
Windows machine was available to exercise the Windows branches live - they
are covered by the unit checks with the Windows primitives simulated, and
that limit is stated rather than hidden.

**What ends the waiting.** Three things can: the program answers, the deadline
passes, or somebody stops Agent Bridge - with an interrupt from the keyboard, or
with a termination or hangup signal. All three become exceptions, so all three
leave by the same route and the same cleanup runs. The signal handlers are put
back exactly as they were found on the way out.

**When a stop raises, and when it waits.** Raising where it lands is right for
exactly one stretch of a turn - the wait for the program's answer - and wrong
for the rest of it.

It is wrong while the child is being created: between the operating system
making the process and this code knowing which group it belongs to, a stop that
raised would leave a running program that nothing had yet taken responsibility
for. It is wrong during cleanup: a second stop arriving while the group is being
emptied would abandon the emptying half done, which is the opposite of what the
person pressing the key wants.

So it is arranged the other way round from what might be expected. A stop is
deferred - written down rather than raised - for the whole life of the child,
and one window is opened, around the wait, where it raises immediately. That
window sits inside the cleanup that catches what it raises. There is therefore
no instruction anywhere between the child appearing and its group being empty at
which a stop can leave without cleanup having run. Once it has, the stop that
was written down is raised.

All three stops go through this, the keyboard interrupt included. Ctrl-C still
raises `KeyboardInterrupt` exactly as it always did, and is handled here for one
reason only: a handler of our own can be made to wait through those moments,
where Python's own cannot. Leaving it out would leave the commonest way of
stopping a program the one way that could still strand a peer.

Deferral changes when a stop is raised, never whether.

**What cannot be cleaned up, honestly.** Four things. Being killed outright with
`SIGKILL` cannot be caught by any program. A machine that loses power runs no
cleanup code. A child that deliberately puts itself into its own session has
left the group this turn owns and can no longer be reached by signalling that
group. And a turn run off the main thread has no handlers at all: Python only
ever delivers a signal to the main thread, and only the main thread may install
a handler, so a termination signal there does whatever the surrounding program
already arranged - which, by default, ends the process at once and leaves the
peer running. The turn still goes ahead in that case, because refusing to work
would be worse, but the tidy exit is not available and is not claimed.

None of the four can be controlled portably, so none of them is pretended about.
The consequence for connectors is concrete: a harness command-line program that
daemonizes during a turn puts its work beyond this cleanup and must therefore
fail qualification.

The deadline covers the useful work: prechecks, the call and the answer. Cleanup
afterwards gets its own separate bounded grace, because a deadline that has
already run out cannot be used to decide how long to wait for a process to die.
